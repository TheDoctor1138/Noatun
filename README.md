All my maps will end up here, and since this is a repo purely for updating maps, I will not bother writing a decent readme (also ignore the destroyed version of noatun, it's there so I don't lose it.)

There is a changelog tho...

*Fixed exposed bedrock issues near the dwarf spawn
*Fixed a misplaced block near first shrine.

If there are issues, please contact me with a stamped letter via owl post.
